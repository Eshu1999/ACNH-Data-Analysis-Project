# Exploratory Data Analysis of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) Items
# Project Overview
# This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on multiple datasets from Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The goal is to understand item pricing, crafting complexity, variants, and availability by analyzing furniture, clothing, and DIY recipe data.

# The analysis is performed primarily at the variant level, where each row represents a unique variation of an item (e.g., color, size, style).

# Objectives
* Clean and understand real-world structured datasets

* Analyze items at the variant level

* Explore pricing trends (Buy vs Sell)

* Analyze crafting materials and recipe complexity

* Identify patterns in availability, styles, and sources

* Practice data cleaning, reshaping, and aggregation techniques

# Datasets Used
* The project uses multiple ACNH datasets including:

* Furniture items

* Clothing items

* DIY recipes

* Houseware and interior items

* Each dataset contains metadata such as:

* Item name and variant

* Buy and Sell prices

* Colors, size, style

* Source and availability

* Crafting materials and quantities (for DIY items)

#Tools & Technologies
* Python

* Pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

* NumPy – numerical operations

* Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

* Jupyter Notebook – analysis and documentation

# Analysis Steps
* Data Understanding

* Examined data types, missing values, and structure

* Identified key columns relevant for analysis

* Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values

* Converted data types where required

* Removed inconsistencies

* Variant-Level Analysis

* Treated each row as a unique item variant

* Analyzed price differences across variants

* Studied size, color, and style distribution

* DIY Recipe Analysis

* Extracted crafting materials

* Calculated total quantity required per material

* Analyzed crafting complexity

* Exploratory Visualization

* Price distribution

* Frequency of item sources

* Material usage patterns

* Availability trends

# Key Insights
* Significant variation exists in Sell prices even among variants of the same item

* Most DIY recipes rely on a small subset of common materials

* Some items are exclusive to specific sources or seasons

* Variant-level analysis provides deeper insights than item-level aggregation

# Limitations
* No time-based data (cannot analyze trends over time)

* Limited data on player demand

* Miles Price values are sparse

# Future Improvements
* Add profitability analysis (Sell price vs crafting cost)

* Combine datasets to build a recommendation system

* Apply clustering to group similar items

* Extend analysis with machine learning models

# Conclusion

* This project demonstrates my ability to:

* Work with real-world datasets

* Clean and analyze structured data

* Apply logical reasoning to data problems

* Communicate insights clearly using visualizations
